# Yolov3

Image Object Detection with OpenCV Darknet Yolo

### Comparison to Other Detectors
YOLOv3 is extremely fast and accurate. In mAP measured at .5 IOU YOLOv3 is on par with Focal Loss but about 4x faster. Moreover, you can easily tradeoff between speed and accuracy simply by changing the size of the model, no retraining required!
